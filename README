Motivation: With the rapid accumulation of genetic data for a
multitude of different species, the availability of intuitive comparative
genomic tools becomes an important requirement for the research
community.

CView is a web-based comparative viewer for mapping data, including
genetic, physical and cytological maps, that is part of the SGN
website (http://sgn.cornell.edu/) but that can also be installed and
adapted for other websites. In addition to viewing and comparing
different maps stored in the SGN database, the viewer allows users to
upload their own maps and compare them to other maps in the
system. The viewer is implemented in object oriented Perl, with a
simple extensible interface to write data adapters for other
relational database schemas and flat file formats
